- Identify stores that are underperforming.
- Optimize the process of item range decision.

In this round, our team leveraged advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to address these challenges. We developed data-driven solutions to help businesses make informed decisions about store performance, resource allocation, equipment, marketing, and staffing.

### Final Round


#### Problem Description

In the Final Round of DataStorm 4.0, our challenge was to optimize product assortment and volume allocation within the allocated freezer types for Beverages Company XYZ. Following our successful provision of an analytical solution in the Semifinal Round, Company XYZ relied on our expertise to maximize their total margin earned from each of their stores.

The key objectives for the Final Round were as follows:
